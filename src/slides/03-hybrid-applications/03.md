## Angular Root Module

app.module.ts
```
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { UpgradeModule } from '@angular/upgrade/static';
@NgModule({
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    UpgradeModule
  ]
})
export class AppModule {
  ngDoBootstrap() {}
}
```

Next up we will need to define our root Angular module. This module is pretty standard as far as Angular goes. The class that you're annotationg has a class method named ngBootstrap but it doesn't have a body. We are developing a hybrid application and we are overriding the default Angular bootstrap functionality by overriding this method with a new method that will do nothing. Its important to note we are bootstrapping the AngularJS application and not the Angular application. The base application, with this approach, will always be an AngularJS application. The other noteworthy addition to our Angular root module is the UpgradeModule, which i sdefined in the imports list for our module. We'll see how that's used next.
