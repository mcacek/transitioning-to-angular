## Upgrading and Downgrading
Just a few thoughts first..

<aside class="notes">
Before we jump into upgrading/downgrading functionality i'll share a few thoughts about the process. My recommendation is to avoid upgrading/downgrading components and instead prefer migrating components and consider upgrading/downgrading injectables instead. If done correctly, most components will end up being quite small and business logic should exist in injectables. I've found that it is most common to need injectables across framework lines rather than component functionality.
