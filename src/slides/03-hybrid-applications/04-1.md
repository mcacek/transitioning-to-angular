## Bootstrapping
### Angular Guide

```
import {
    platformBrowserDynamic
} from '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic';

platformBrowserDynamic()
    .bootstrapModule(AppModule).then(platformRef => {
        const upgrade = platformRef.injector.get(UpgradeModule) as UpgradeModule;
        upgrade.bootstrap(document.body, ['heroApp'], {strictDi: true});
    });
```

As I mentioned before, we're bootstrapping an AngularJS application but we're using the UpgradeModule provided by Angular. We are importing dynamic browser platform, which performs just in time compilation with the target platform being the browser. We are then creating an instance of the platform and calling the bootstrapModule method which expects a Angular module (previously defined). The boostrapModule method resolves to a platformRef which we can then use to retrieve an instance of the UpgradeModule. Once we've retrieved teh UpgradeModule it's as simple as calling the bootstrap method with the exactly same arguments that we used when bootstraping the AngularJS application. The result of this application should be a fully functional hybrid application.
