## Downgrading Components
### AngularJS Module

```
import { HeroDetailComponent } from './hero-detail.component';

import { downgradeComponent } from '@angular/upgrade/static';
angular.module('heroApp', [])
  .directive(
    'heroDetail',
    downgradeComponent({component: HeroDetailComponent}) as angular.IDirectiveFactory
  );
```

The previous examples demonstrated the process of starting up a very simple application and while it is impressive that we can easily startup an environment that includes both AngularJS and Angular, it isn't all that useful just yet. Being that we've gone to the effort of including Angular in our application, we might as well start creating Angular components rather than writing the counterpart in AngularJS styling. We can go ahead and create our new Angular component with no consideration for its future inclusion in an AngularJS application. Once we're ready to put it to use in our AngularJS application we'll simply need to downgrade the component using another Angular provided function, downgradeComponent.
