## Upgrading Components
### AngularJS Component

```
export const heroDetail = {
  template: `
    <h2>Windstorm details!</h2>
    <div><label>id: </label>1</div>
  `,
  controller: function() {
  }
};
```

Here we have a very very simple AngularJS component. You'll probably notice right away that this isn't a very useful component. It has no inputs or outputs, but that doesn't mean that we can't upgrade a more complex component. Unfortunately I don't have enough time to deep dive into that but just know that is is possible and easy to do.
