What exactly is a Hybrid Application? A hybrid application is an AngularJS application that is bootstrapped by the UpgradeModule provided Angular. You are taking your existing AngularJS application and starting it up using a combination of both AngularJS and Angular. This is the quickest way to get up and going with Angular, but it is important to note that we are ADDING to the payload that our users will be required to download in order to use our application. Our codebase will now include both AngularJS and Angular runtimes. This can be an immediate deal breaker for some companies depending on constraints. The amount of code change required is minimal, but you're adding dependencies that your end uers will need to download. With that said, it is very slick. Let's dive into how this works and now we accomplish it.
