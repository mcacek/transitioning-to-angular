## Combined Routing

```
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
@Component({
  selector: 'my-app',
  template: `
    <router-outlet></router-outlet>
    <div ng-view></div>
  `,
})
export class AppComponent { }
```

One very interesting option to take under consideration is to used a combined routing approach and simply draw a line in the sand. You can maintain the routing tables separately and migrate functionality one route at a time. I really like this approach because it allow for a gradual migration and I find that its really easy to keep in my head. The Nrwl team refers to this the vertical slicing approach, as opposed to horizontal slicing. You isolate routes for upgrade rather than individual components. You can initialize and empty routing table for your new Angular work and then choose a nice starting point and move only that route into your Angular app. This is a great approach for a gradual migration. Most applications are organized by routes already so it really lends itself well to this process. This is just an example and there is a little more setup involved (UrlHandlingStrategy).
