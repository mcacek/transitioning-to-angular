## AngularJS Bootstrapping

### Directive
```
<body ng-app="heroApp" ng-strict-di></body>
```

### Script
```
angular.bootstrap(document.body, ['heroApp'], {strictDi: true});
```

Both examples above are valid ways to bootstrap an AngularJS application. They have the same result, so why use the script version? Simply put, Angular does not have an ngApp directive. For that reason, I recommend bootstrapping your application via a script rather than using the ngApp directive. In the following slides I will demonstrate how the script-based approach will benefit us when it comes time to start our hybrid application.
