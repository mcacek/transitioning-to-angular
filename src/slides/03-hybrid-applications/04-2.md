## Bootstrapping
### Nrwl Approach

```
m.directive('appRoot', downgradeComponent({component: AppComponent}));

...

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    UpgradeModule,
  ],
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  entryComponents: [AppComponent]
})
class AppModule {
  constructor(private upgrade: UpgradeModule) {}

  ngDoBootstrap() {
    this.upgrade.bootstrap(document, ['AngularJsAppModule']);
  }
}
```

The previous slide is an example from the Angular docs but I really think that this example from the team at Nrwl approach looks a lot cleaner. Their team refers to this as the "Upgrade Shell".
