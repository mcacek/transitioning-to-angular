## Downgrading Components
### Angular Module

```
import { HeroDetailComponent } from './hero-detail.component';
@NgModule({
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    UpgradeModule
  ],
  declarations: [
    HeroDetailComponent
  ],
  entryComponents: [
    HeroDetailComponent
  ]
})
export class AppModule {
  ngDoBootstrap() {}
}
```

Lastly because this is an Angular component we will need to declare the the component by adding it to the Angular modules. Unlike most other components, we will also need to include our component in the Angular module's entryComponents list. If you haven't worked with the entryComponents property before it's probably because Angular has automated the process for you in the past. We need to manually add our component to the entryComponents list because twe're using the component imperatively rather than declaritively via a selector in the DOM. Most components are used declaratively via selectors. As a result, these components are considered "entry poitns" into the Angular application. If you've used components in your router configuration, then you've already seen another imperative use but fortunately Angular automatically adds these components for us.
