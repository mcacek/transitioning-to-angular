## Upgrading Components
### Angular Component

```
import { Directive, ElementRef, Injector } from '@angular/core';
import { UpgradeComponent } from '@angular/upgrade/static';
@Directive({
  selector: 'hero-detail'
})
export class HeroDetailDirective extends UpgradeComponent {
  constructor(elementRef: ElementRef, injector: Injector) {
    super('heroDetail', elementRef, injector);
  }
}
```

The process of upgrading a component, as demonstrated here, is pretty simple. We're relying on Angular to do the heavy lifting. We simply create a class that extends UpgradeComponent and annotate it with @Directive (not @Component!). Once we have a our annotated class we'll simply need to use constructor injection to get a reference tothe element for the component and also the AngularJS injector, and call super with construct arguments for our parent UpgradeComponent. Add this component to your Angular Module and it is ready to use. As I mentioned, we are registering this component as a Directive and there is a good reason for that. Angular is unaware that AngularJS will create elements underneath this directive and treats this directive as a basic HTML tag in that ignores all child elements.
