There are ways to improve your development practices now that will prepare you for the future. The first of which is the excellent Angular style guide. Make sure that your directory structures and filenaming conventions adhere. You'll be glad that you  did. A lot of teams still have their business logic condensed into controllers. This can be a real problem if you want to reuse that logic in Angular. I recommend moving that business logic into services that can then be upgraded for use in Angular. Upgrade to the latest release of AngularJS to ensure the greatest compatibility. Do everything that you can to avoid two-way binding. Its slow and usually not necessary. Review all of your custom directives and convert them to components. It'll end up being less code and you'll be ready to reuse them via upgraded components in Angular.
