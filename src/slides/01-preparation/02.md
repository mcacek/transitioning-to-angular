## Typescript

* Add Types
* Convert to Classes

<aside class="notes">
One of the first things that you should consider is adding TypeScript to your codebase. This is a great first step as your existing AngularJS codebase and your Angular codebase will not only start looking a lot alike but you'll also improve compatibility among the two. TypeScript also has tooling benefits such as improved Intellisense support that you'll probably notice pretty quickly. You'll also inevitably be using TypeScript, so an early adoption will help with the transition even if you're not ready to start using Angular.
