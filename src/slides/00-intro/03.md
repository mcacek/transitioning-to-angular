## Transitioning to Angular
What am I talking about?

<aside class="notes">
Angular has been out and stable for awhile not but people are still not sure what to do with it. How do you prepare for a new framework? What about my existing codebase? Is our AngularJS code going to be compatible with Angular or will we have to start from scratch? That sounds horrible.

Before I get started let me prefice that I'm expecting that people understand, at least to a small degree, how to build Angular applications. If that is not the case for you, then I apologize. I'll do my best to help out along the way.
